"There are also the harms of Covid-19 testing to consider.

Perhaps the biggest challenge is false negatives — tests signaling no infection in those who are indeed infected. Covid-19 testing is typically performed on samples from behind the nose or in the back of the mouth, and will be positive only if the sample happens to contain the virus. In some people, the virus may be present in high quantities only deep in the lungs. False negatives occur surprisingly often — perhaps as often as one-third of the time — which could lead to a false sense of security among those with such results.

Testing those without symptoms can also lead to false alarms. PCR testing for the virus, which is the best way to identify an active infection, can detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 — or remnants of it — for weeks, even when the infection is unlikely to be transmitted to others. Testing the entire population would undoubtedly identify a large number of such individuals, unnecessarily sidelining them from work and society.",<triplet> testing <subj> sidelining <obj> cause

who have very different pre-job loss earnings: $600 is a larger percentage of pre-job loss earnings for low
than for high earners. The CARES Act implemented a fixed supplement to all workers in part because it
was viewed as infeasible to implement policies which depended on individual earnings. Since the $600 UI
supplement was targeted to generate 100% earnings replacement based on mean earnings, this $600 sup-
plement tends to imply greater than 100% earnings replacement for those with less than mean earnings.
Furthermore, these high replacement rates for below-mean workers are amplified by the fact that the dis-
tribution of earnings is skewed: median earnings are less than mean earnings. This means that the typical
unemployed worker has below-mean prior earnings and thus above-mean replacement rates. This implies
that most workers have replacement rates above 100%.",<triplet> skewed <subj> amplified <obj> cause
