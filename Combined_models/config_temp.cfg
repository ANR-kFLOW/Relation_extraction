text_from_user = here are some test sentences. I need to see if this works. hello hello 3.5. help me see if this works. The responses should be a mess. I need to figure out the right amount of sentences in order to let the program run. help me with the process. these are words and multiple words form a sentence. sentences form paragraphs. I was distracted so I fell. when I hit the ground I hurt myself. when you water a plant in the future it will grow. I was sad so I listened to music. I need more samples so I create more samples. Dropping the cup made me frustrated. Pushing the domino made it fall. The wind blowing made the house of cards fall. After dieting I lost weight. I was late because the strikes happend. seeing this caused me to be sad. watching food videos made me hungry. I was thristy so I drank water.
